# Library for DeebotOzmo 960/950/920

A simple command-line python script to drive a robot vacuum. Currently
known to work with the Ecovacs Deebot 960/950/920 from both North America and Europe.

## Installation

If you have a recent version of Python 3, you should be able to
do `pip install deebotozmo` to get the most recently released version of
this.

## Usage

To get started, you'll need to have already set up an EcoVacs account
using your smartphone.

You are welcome to try using this as a python library for other efforts.
A simple usage might go something like this:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio
import logging
import random
import string

from deebotozmo.commands import *
from deebotozmo.ecovacs_api import EcovacsAPI
from deebotozmo.ecovacs_mqtt import EcovacsMqtt
from deebotozmo.ecovacs_json import EcovacsJSON
from deebotozmo.events import BatteryEvent
from deebotozmo.util import md5
from deebotozmo.vacuum_bot import VacuumBot


device_id = "".join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for _ in range(12))
email = "your email or phonenumber (cn)"
password_hash = md5("yourPassword")
continent = "eu"
country = "de"


async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
        api = EcovacsAPI(session, device_id, email, password_hash, continent=continent, country=country, verify_ssl=False)
        await api.login()

        devices_ = await api.get_devices()

        auth = await api.get_request_auth()
        bot = VacuumBot(session, auth, devices_[0], continent=continent, country=country, verify_ssl=False)

        mqtt = EcovacsMqtt(auth, continent=continent)
        await mqtt.subscribe(bot)

        async def on_battery(event: BatteryEvent):
            # Do stuff on battery event
            if event.value == 100:
                # Battery full
                pass

        # Subscribe for events (more events available)
        bot.batteryEvents.subscribe(on_battery)

        # Execute commands
        await bot.execute_command(CleanStart())
        await asyncio.sleep(900)  # Wait for...
        await bot.execute_command(Charge())


if __name__ == '__main__':
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.create_task(main())
    loop.run_forever()
```
